# Housing data for Luxembourg

These scripts for the R programming language download nominal
housing prices from the *Observatoire de l'Habitat* and
tidy them up into a flat data frame.

- save_data.R: downloads, cleans, and creates data frames from the data
- analysis.R: creates plots of the data

The aim is to build a fully functional and complete Reproducible
Analytical Pipeline (RAP). I hope to continue the skills I learn
from this in my own professional work.
